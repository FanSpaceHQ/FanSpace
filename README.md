Expand your orbit!

# Our Mission
Have you ever missed out on a concert/music festival just because you had nobody to go with you?

Have you ever spent more money on Uber fees than the cost of the concert ticket itself?

Have you ever wondered what other students like the same artists as you? 

Our mobile application aims to help students connect with other students with similar interests and music taste and allows them to coordinate their concert experiences with others.

# Our Technology

- Firebase
  - Realtime Database
